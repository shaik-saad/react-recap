# React Counter Project

This project implements a simple counter, with two buttons; one to increase the count and the other to decrease the count.

- This project was a part of react recap from [Chai aur React](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu71SKxNbfoDqgPchmvIsL4hTnJIrtige&si=VQvNpWxieMenCStv) series by Hitesh Chaudhary on YT.
